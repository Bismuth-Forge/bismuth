Arrange your windows automatically and switch between them using keyboard
shortcuts. All of that with different layouts and without a complicated setup
of classic tiling window managers (i3, dwm or XMonad). Just install the script
on any KDE Plasma powered Linux distribution and enjoy your computing! ü¶æ

This is a fork of [Krohnkite](https://github.com/esjeon/krohnkite). The fork
was made, because the old project seems to be unmaintained. If you want to
import your old shortcuts from it, use the `contrib/import_krohnkite.sh`
script.

## üåü Features and Goals

- Full KDE Plasma integration
  - Multiple Screens, Activities and Virtual desktops
  - Built-in KWin features (minimize, full-screen and rules)
  - Floating Dialog windows
- Multiple Layouts
  - Classic Tiling layout
  - Monocle layout for focusing on one application
  - Three-Column for wide monitors
  - Floating layout for traditional experience
- Works on Wayland Plasma session

## üîß Installation

### From Source

Install script from source:

    npm install # Installs dependencies for building
    npm run bi-install # Installs all Bismuth components

To uninstall:

    npm run bi-uninstall

### I want a simple installation!

Understandable. Bismuth is a complex extension to KDE Plasma and therefore it
requires complex packaging for different Linux distributions, at least for main
ones: Ubuntu-based, Fedora-based and Arch-based. This is a complex task, so if
you're skillful, you're welcome to create a package for your distribution and
share it with others via PR to Bismuth.

### Tweaks

You may want to make a couple of manual fixes and tweaks, to improve your
experience. See [Tweaks section](TWEAKS.md).
