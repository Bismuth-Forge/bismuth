# üåà Bismuth

[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

Arrange your windows automatically and switch between them using keyboard shortcuts. All of that with different layouts and
without a complicated setup of classic tiling window managers (i3, dwm or XMonad). Just install the script on any
KDE Plasma powered Linux distribution and enjoy your computing! ü¶æ

![script demo](img/demo.gif)

This is a fork of [Krohnkite](https://github.com/esjeon/krohnkite). The fork was made, because the old project seems to be unmaintained.

## üó∫Ô∏è Goals

Project goals are the following:

1. Provide full-fledged tiling window manager experience in KDE Plasma with minimal effort on user side
2. Wayland support

## üåü Features

- Automatic window tiling
  - Dynamically tile windows, rather than manually placing each.
  - Floating windows
- Fully integrates into KWin features, including:
  - Multi-screen
  - Activities & Virtual desktop
  - Basic window management (minimize, fullscreen, switching, etc)
- Multiple Layout Support
  - Tiling layout
  - Monocle layout
  - Desktop-friendly layouts (Spread, Stair)

## üîß Installation

Install script via script:

    npm install # Installs dependencies for building
    npm run script-install

To uninstall:

    npm run script-uninstall

### Enabling User-Configuration

<!-- TODO: This section should not exist in ideal world. -->

[It is reported][kwinconf] that a manual step is required to enable user
configuration of KWin scripts. This is a limitation of KWin scripting.

To enable configuration, you must perform the following in command-line:

    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/kservices5/
    ln -s ~/.local/share/kwin/scripts/bismuth/metadata.desktop ~/.local/share/kservices5/bismuth.desktop

A configuration button will appear in `KWin Scripts` in `System Settings`.

![config button shown](img/scripts_kcm_item.png)

To make changes effective, **the script must be reactivated**:

1. On `KWin Scripts` dialog, untick Bismuth
2. `Apply`
3. tick Bismuth
4. `Apply`
