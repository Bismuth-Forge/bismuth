Arrange your windows automatically and switch between them using keyboard shortcuts. All of that with different layouts and
without a complicated setup of classic tiling window managers (i3, dwm or XMonad). Just install the script on any
KDE Plasma powered Linux distribution and enjoy your computing! ü¶æ

This is a fork of [Krohnkite](https://github.com/esjeon/krohnkite). The fork
was made, because the old project seems to be unmaintained. If you want to
import your old shortcuts from it, use the `contrib/import_krohnkite.sh`
script.

## üó∫Ô∏è Goals

Project goals are the following:

1. Provide full-fledged tiling window manager experience in KDE Plasma with minimal effort on user side
2. Wayland support

## üåü Features

- Automatic window tiling
  - Dynamically tile windows, rather than manually placing each.
  - Floating windows
- Fully integrates into KWin features, including:
  - Multi-screen
  - Activities & Virtual desktop
  - Basic window management (minimize, fullscreen, switching, etc)
- Multiple Layout Support
  - Tiling layout
  - Monocle layout
  - Desktop-friendly layouts (Spread, Stair)

## üîß Installation

Install script from source:

    npm install # Installs dependencies for building
    npm run script-install

To uninstall:

    npm run script-uninstall

### Tweaks

Note, that if you've installed the script from the KWin scripts installation
dialog, you need to make a couple of manual fixes and tweaks. See [Tweaks
section](TWEAKS.md).
