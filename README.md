Arrange your windows automatically and switch between them using keyboard
shortcuts. All of that with different layouts and without a complicated setup
of classic tiling window managers (i3, dwm or XMonad). Just install Bismuth
on any KDE Plasma powered Linux distribution and you are ready to go! ü¶æ

![script demo](img/demo.gif)

This is a fork of [Krohnkite](https://github.com/esjeon/krohnkite). The fork
was made, because the old project seems to be unmaintained. If you want to
import your old shortcuts from it, use the `contrib/import_krohnkite.sh`
script.

## üåü Features

- Full KDE Plasma integration
  - Multiple Screens, Activities and Virtual desktops
  - Built-in KWin features (minimize, full-screen and rules)
  - Floating Dialog windows
- Multiple Layouts
  - Classic Tiling layout
  - Monocle layout for focusing on one application
  - Three-Column for wide monitors
  - Floating layout for traditional experience
- Works on Wayland Plasma session
