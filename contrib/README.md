# ðŸ”§ Tweaks after installation

## Setting Up for Multi-Screen

Bismuth supports multi-screen setup, but KWin has to be configured to unlock
the full potential of the script.

1. Enable `Separate Screen Focus` under `Window Management` >
   `Window Behavior` > `Multiscreen Behaviour`
2. Bind keys for global shortcut `Switch to Next/Previous Screen`
   (Recommend: `Meta + ,` / `Meta + .`)
3. Bind keys for global shortcut `Window to Next/Previous Screen`
   (Recommend: `Meta + <` / `Meta + >`)

Note: `Separate Screen Focus` appears only when multiple monitors are present.

## Setting Minimum Geometry Size

Some applications like discord and KDE settings don't tile nicely as they have
a minimum size requirement. This causes the applications to overlap with other
applications. To mitigate this we can set minimum size for all windows to be 0.

1. `System Setting` > `Window Management` > `Window Rules`
2. Click on `+ Add New...`
3. Set `Window class` to be `Unimportant`
4. Set `Window types` to `Normal Window`
5. Click `+ Add Properties...`
6. Add the `Minimum Size` Property
7. Set the fields to `Force` and `0` x `0`
8. Apply
